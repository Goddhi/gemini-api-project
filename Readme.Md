# Cloud Workload Protection System

A solution designed to detect, classify, and respond to security threats in Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE) Workloads on Google Cloud. Leveraging the Gemini APIâ€™s advanced threat intelligence capabilities, this project automatically analyzes log data from applications deployed on GKE to provide predictive insights and threat classification.


The Cloud Workload Protection System is a security platform designed to protect applications running in GKE. It captures, analyzes, and classifies logs in  using the Gemini API, providing insights into potential threats, including DDoS attacks, unauthorized access, and suspicious IP addresses. This system automates incident response by blocking identified threats and sending alerts to security teams, ensuring that cloud environments remain secure and resilient against modern cyber threats.

**Technologies Used**: Gemini API, Vertex AI, Cloud Logging, Google Kubernetes Engine, cloud Run, Python, Terraform
